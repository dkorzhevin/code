Installing Software



The Plan
========

* Install software on your system.
* Test that it works right.



Linux Install
=====

On Ubuntu 19.10 I used:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

Linux Testing
=====

Test that your C compiler works with:

    $ cc --version

Sample output:

$ cc --version
cc (Ubuntu 9.2.1-9ubuntu2) 9.2.1 20191008

Text Editors
=====

You should already have one.
Just don't use an IDE. They aren't very helpful.
